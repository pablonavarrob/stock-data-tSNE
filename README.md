# Anlysis of stock market data using t-SNE

Analysis of log returns from stock market data using Python and dimensionality reduction (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, t-SNE). The code encompasses several unstructured analysis, as well as the creation of synthetic data using Brownian motion (defined from scratch).

## t-SNE on the 5-day average returns for S&P500 companies

Companies from the S&P500 analyzed with t-SNE and DBSCAN applied on the result.
